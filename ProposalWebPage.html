<p>As our society continues to grow and advance, food production will become a larger issue than it already is. Population growth and growing demand for food, biofuels, and other plant-derived materials is putting greater pressure on the agriculture industry to increase production. At the same time, the cropland needed to satisfy these needs competes with land used for environmental protection and global sustainability, as well as the spread of urban areas. It is clear that we need a sustainable and environmentally sound method to increase crop growth to feed the world and satisfy industrial applications. (Ort et al., 2015)</p>
<p>Because of the Green Revolution, researchers and engineers have been able to manipulate plants and their environments in order to increase plant output; however, some intrinsic attributes of plant have still limited the extent to which plant production can be increased. These attributes include the efficiency of plant photosynthesis to convert light energy into chemical energy to be used to fuel biological processes(Ort et al., 2015; Isaacson, 2014).</p> 
<p>Several barriers need to be considered when dealing with increasing photosynthetic efficiency(Ort et al., 2015). According to Donald Ort and other researchers (2015), “The inability of photosynthesis to efficiently use high midday light intensities also strongly limits productivity compared with hypothetical plants able to use high intensity light as efficiently as low intensity light. The slow catalytic rate of the carboxylation enzyme Rubisco is a major barrier to increasing the rate of carbon assimilation at the leaf level”. This means that plants are not converting sunlight as efficiently as is hypothetically possible(Naeem et al., 2013 ; Ort et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2014). Many methods to increase photosynthetic efficiency were proposed, including decreasing light absorbency and optimizing carbon capture. Of all of the solutions proposed by those researchers, the solution that is the focus of my research is genetically manipulating plants in order to have a different, more efficient photosystem. In traditional plants, multiple photosystems compete for the same wavelengths of light, rather than taking advantage of more of the spectrum(Ort et al., 2015). By genetically manipulating the photosystems found in plants for those found in organisms such as cyanobacteria, we could increase their efficiency. If plants are genetically modified to have genes found in photosynthetic bacteria and algae, then their photosynthetic efficiency will increase and the amount of growth will also increase.</p></div>

<div style="background-color: #729273"><h3>Literature Review</h3>
<p>Many researchers agree that photosynthesis is an aspect of biology that is not perfect. Its efficiency varies among different organisms and on an agricultural stance, it can be manipulated in order to increase output. Organisms such as algae and cryptophytes have genetic abilities that allow them to take advantage of more light wavelengths, rather than competing for the same type of light. Researchers at the University of Toronto find that quantum coherence is the quality of cryptophytes that allows them to gather light energy more effectively(Space Daily, 2014). According to the University of South Wales(2014), when a system is coherent, it can use superposition to collect light in many different wavelengths because coherent systems are able to exist in many different states simultaneously. As a result of quantum coherence, algae and cryptophytes are capable of living in areas with very little sunlight (Ort et al., 2015; Space Daily, 2014; University of South Wales, 2014;).</p>

<p>In traditional plants, two photosystems are present in plant cells. However, these systems both absorb the same types of light according to wavelength. Photosynthetic bacteria; however, take advantage of different wavelengths, including those closer to the IR region of the spectrum, showing that it is biologically possible to take advantage of those wavelengths. Photosystems found in bacteria such as Blastochloris viridis  use light up to 1,075 nm, whereas photosystems in traditional plants only use light up to 700 nm. Additionally, cyanobacteria such as Acaryochloris marina are capable of utilizing light around 730 nm. Plant cells that are modified to have the photosystems found in these organisms could perform photosynthesis that is twice as efficient as their unmodified versions. By genetically giving crop plants the genes found in  Acaryochloris marina and Blastochloris viridis, as well as those found in cryptophytes the efficiency of plant conversion of sunlight into food and other materials could be increased even further.(Ort et al., 2015)</p> </div>

<div style="background-color: #00FFFF"><h3>Methods</h3><p>Objectives:</p>
<p>Find the most efficient way for plants to perform photosynthesis with different photosystems.</p>
<p>Attempt to genetically modify a plant in order to increase its efficiency.</p>
<p>Measure the overall difference in photosynthetic efficiency between conventional plants and one genetically modified to be more efficient.</p>
<p>The independent variable of this experiment is the presence of foreign DNA. The dependent variable will be the amount of growth of the plant. Genetic modification will be accomplished via transformation of the plant cells. This involves making the Agrobacterium very warm, then very cold while exposed to foreign DNA. This temporarily opens the cell and allows foreign DNA to enter(Lang, 2013).The foreign DNA will include the DNA from the cyanobacteria and the cryptophyte bacteria. Additionally, in order to be able to tell whether or not a plant is genetically modified, the gene for GFP-fluorescence will also be modified into the plant. This gene allows for the organism to glow when an ultraviolet light is shined on it(Lang, 2013; Haseloff et al., 1997). This way, there will be a noticeable difference between plants that are modified, and those that are not. GFP-fluorescence is not only being added to tell the plants apart, but also to see if the genetic modification is successful(Haseloff et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Once the Agrobacterium takes in the DNA, it will be placed on the buds of of the plant. The plant that will be used in Arabidopsis plant, due the large amount of research that has already been performed on the genetic traits of the plant as well as its fast growing time. After several hours, the plant will have accepted the foreign DNA from the Agrobacterium. After several weeks, the buds will bloom and the genetically modified seeds can be collected and planted.
In order to test if photosynthetic efficiency has been increased, the plant growth will be compared to that of unmodified seeds. Each plant will receive the same amount of light, nutrients, and water. Their growth will be measured by their height and weight. I will measure the plants’ height every day that they are growing and I will measure their weight once a week. I will weigh them by removing the plants from their soil, washing and drying them, then weighing them on a scale, followed by replanting them. This weight is known as the fresh weight. At the end of the experiment, I will measure the dry weight of the plants, which is more reliable, by removing the plants, drying them in an oven at 100 degrees Fahrenheit overnight, and then weighing them.</p></div>

<div style="background-color: #287423"><h3>Plan of Action and Timeline</h3>
<p>In order to experimentally prove whether or not genes found in various bacteria and cryptophytes are capable of being transferred into crop plants in order to increase photosynthetic efficiency and as a result the overall output of those plants, a genetically modified plant needs to made for testing. This can only be made by first acquiring the specific genes of those various organisms. Because of the immense amount of research and machinery that is involved with isolating an individual gene, those genes will be acquired from other researchers at other universities and research institutes.</p>
<p>Once the genetic materials are acquired, the next step is to get them inside of the cells of a plant. I will also use agrobacterium to transfer the genes into the plant cells, a process known as transformation. The seeds of the new genetically modified plant will then be gathered and planted.</p>
<p>I will then compare the growth rate and amount of the genetically modified seedlings that of non-genetically modified seedlings over several weeks of growth. I will make sure that the plants all receive the same amount of light and nutrients and are subject to all the same conditions. I will perform the entire experiment at the greenhouse at Norfolk Technical Center. </p></div>

<div style="background-color:#435425"><h3>Plan for Evaluation</h3>
<p>In order to evaluate the success of my experiment, I will analyze the heights and weights of the various plants. If my hypothesis is correct, then the plants that have the foreign DNA will have grown larger. To make sure that extra growth isn’t due to nutrient or water differences, I will make sure that all of the resources, such as light amount and soil nutrients, for all of the plants are the same. Seeing as the efficiency of photosynthesis should be significantly improved in the genetically modified versions of the plants, the growth difference should be noticeably significant. It could be argued that the presence of GFP-fluorescent gene could also alter the growth rate of the Arabidopsis plant; however, research performed at North Carolina State University has shown that GFP-fluorescent protein can be used as an effective tracer for transgenic plants(Haseloff et al., 1997).</p></div>
